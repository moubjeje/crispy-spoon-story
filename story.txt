	There was once a child who wanted to taste the fountain of youth.
Typically eternity's cup is sought by those who feel the pursuant breath of death
closing in, but not in this case. At this stage of her life, death was nothing
more than a distant story to the girl -- a villain in a wonderful adventure, just
like in the exciting stories she listened to whenever she went to sleep. And children
are driven by the most imaginative dreams. So where others desired to become princesses
or ride noble steed, this girl sought to defeat death. All she had was a map to the
living waters and some dry, absorbent cereal fashioned into a crispy spoon.

So one night, against the wishes of her parents, she slipped into the night with her 
crispy spoon, her map, and her dream. After a few hours of 
following her map into the forest, something felt wrong. She felt like someone was
watching her. Almost like the trees had eyes. She began to walk faster, run almost until
she came upon a clearing in the middle of the forest. A single old woman sat in the middle
holding two large bags, one in each hand. The woman looked like she could have been 500 
years old. She approached the woman and the woman turned around looked her dead in the eyes
outstreatched her finger wrinkly crooked frail finger, pointed it directly at her and said,
"I've been waiting for you". The girl froze and a freezing sensation shot down her spine.
"I knew you would read the map wrong" the old woman crackled. The girl fainted.

However, despite the words that woman said, the woman led her to a cozy house. Inside the house,
there were many pretty and wonderful dolls. "Choose what you want, and you are allowed to bring
the doll when you go back to home." said the woman. Among the dolls, a girl selected a 
horse-shaped doll. "You have to clear some missions if you want to go back to your house, and the
doll will protect you when you are in danger."
